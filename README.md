Ludu (Ludo) is a Bangladeshi Native Game. It is well known in this country. This game is also played in other countries.
This program lets you play Ludu game in a single computer with at most 4 players. This is not a multiplayer online game, this is a "real" player offline game. 2, 3 or 4 players can play in a single game. Team play is also possible. This is not the snake side of Ludu, this is the opposide board game side. Complex moves such as double move (playing two pawns in a single move when two of them are in the same place etc.) is also possible.
This is an old program. New JDK (java development kit) versions may not support full game as key listeners are not working. Its only supported in JDK1.3. If you download old JDK1.3 and run the game using that then it works perfectly as tested on year 2023 in a computer with Windows 11 operating system.
